## Hello! 👋
I am passionate about creating and have extensive experience in turning ideas into actual products. Currently, I work as a product manager for a remote cross-border team. I have a solid understanding of programming and development and can effectively communicate with engineers to coordinate and manage project timelines, ensuring that the product is completed within the allotted time frame and meets the needs of customers. I am also committed to continuous learning to expand my skills and knowledge and further develop myself.

### Here are some thoughts to help you get to know me better:

- 🔭 I am working on some side projects and will be converting some of them into public NPM packages.
  - https://github.com/HCYT/notionAI 
- 🌱 I'm learning about the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence and plan to apply them to my next product.
- ✨ I'm looking forward to collaborating with other product managers and developers to better understand and respond to changes in the market and technology.
