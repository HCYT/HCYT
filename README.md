## Hello! 👋
I am passionate about creating and have extensive experience in turning ideas into actual products. Currently, I work as a product manager for a remote cross-border team. I have a solid understanding of programming and development and can effectively communicate with engineers to coordinate and manage project timelines, ensuring that the product is completed within the allotted time frame and meets the needs of customers. I am also committed to continuous learning to expand my skills and knowledge and further develop myself.
