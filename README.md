# Danny (CYH) ‚Äî Founder & Product Builder

Hello! üëã I build products end-to-end‚Äîfrom problem framing to shipped software. I bridge product and engineering, with a focus on **AI/LLM applications**, **computer-vision skincare analysis**, and **developer tooling**.

## Currently Building
- **Ingrelens (cosGlint)** ‚Äî Third-party cosmetics ingredient & skin decision assistant: scan labels, interpret risk/effectiveness, and get personalized guidance.  
  ‚ûú https://ingrelens.com
- **Termdock** ‚Äî A lightweight AI coding terminal aiming for less IDE ceremony and more command-driven flow.  
  ‚ûú https://github.com/HCYT/Termdock

## What I‚Äôm exploring right now
- FindSkin POC: face-region masks, redness/oil/spot detection, and explainable scoring (Mediapipe + classic CV).
- RAG pipelines for skincare research and content retrieval.
- Task-oriented AI agents that self-update priorities and execute scripts with guardrails.

## Skills & Tools
**Product:** strategy, discovery interviews, roadmap & delivery, metrics & experimentation  
**Engineering:** FastAPI (Python), TypeScript, Next.js, React Native (Expo), PostgreSQL, Docker, CI/CD  
**AI/ML:** OpenAI API, RAG, prompt & eval, computer vision (Mediapipe/OpenCV)

## Work Style
I like small, fast iterations, measurable outcomes, and honest trade-offs. Remote-first; comfortable leading cross-border teams and speaking both product and code.
