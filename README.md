# Danny (CYH) — Founder & Product Builder

I build intelligent products from concept to launch, focusing on AI/LLM, developer tools, and computer vision for skincare. With 10+ years in product and engineering, I bridge strategy and code—precision over speed for mature products.

## Work Style
I drive fast, focused iterations and prioritize measurable outcomes, but always anchor decisions in technical clarity and business impact. I lead remote-first teams, balance product vision with engineering execution, and thrive on building scalable solutions that ship quickly—without sacrificing long-term value.
