### Hello! ðŸ‘‹
I love creating and have rich experience in turning ideas into actual products. Currently, I work as a product manager who has a solid understanding of programming and development. I can effectively communicate with engineers to coordinate and manage project timelines, ensuring that the product is completed within the allotted time frame and meets the needs of customers. I'm also committed to continuous learning to expand my skills and knowledge and further develop myself.

Here are some thoughts to help you get to know me better:

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on a project that generates high-quality content and has released an NPM package for it.
  - https://github.com/HCYT/notionAI 
- ðŸŒ± I'm learning about the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence and plan to apply them to my next product.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking forward to collaborating with other product managers and developers to better understand and respond to changes in the market and technology.
- ðŸ’¬ Please feel free to ask me any questions related to product management and software development.
- ðŸ“« You can contact me through my email cyh@hcytlog.com .
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I used to be an engineer and still occasionally develop.
